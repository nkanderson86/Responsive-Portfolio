                <p> Now this is a story all about how
                    my life got flipped turned upside down
                    and I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
                    I'll tell you how I become the prince of a town called Bel Air... </p>

                <p> In west Philadelphia born and raised
                    on the playground is where I spent most of my days
                    chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
                    and all shootin' some b ball outside of the school
                    when a couple of guys who were up to no good
                    started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
                    I got in one little fight and my mon scared
                    and said you're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air
                    I begged and pleaded with her day after day
                    but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
                    she give me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
                    put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it
                    first class yo this is bad
                    drinkin' orange juice out of a champagne glass
                    is this what the people of Bel-Air live like
                    hmmm this might be all right
                    but wait I hear they're prissy? and all that
                    is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat
                    I don't think so I'll see when I get there
                    I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air </p>

                <p> Well uh the plane landed and when I came out
                    there was a dude looked like a cop standin' there with my name out
                    I ain't tryin' to get arrested yet I just got here
                    I sprang with the quickness like lightening disapeared
                    I whistled for a cab and when it came near
                    the licensce plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
                    if anything I could say that this cab was rare
                    but I thought man forget it yo homes to Bel-Air
                    I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
                    and I yelled to the cabbie yo homes smell ya later
                    looked at my kingdom I was finally there
                    to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air!</p>
