# Responsive-Portfolio


This was a fun exercise, and I had to stop myself from trying to re-write my first homework assignment to make it easier to style.  I think I figured out most of what I was trying to do.  

A couple of things that I didn't quite get:
- On contact page with the screen size small the outline around the input areas disappears and so it's tought to tell unless you have one highlight where the input box is. 
- On the portfolio page, once it swtiches to two boxes per row, trying to get those to center.  
- I didn't do anything for the largest break point, I figured it was already styled for that size so I'm not sure what that third media query does or if I should've had *some* styling to go along with it.
